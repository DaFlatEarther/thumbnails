"""MCP server for AI thumbnail generation via Nano Banana Pro.

Exposes one tool — `generate_thumbnail` — and one UI resource. Tool calls
trigger image generation; the widget renders the result inline and lets the
user iterate without going back through the chat.

Run locally (stdio, for `mcp dev` or Claude Desktop):
    python server.py

Run as remote streamable-HTTP MCP (recommended for claude.ai connectors):
    uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8003

    "  large, well-lit, expressive — close-up to medium shot, eye contact "
    "  with viewer or a strong emotional cue (joy, shock, intensity, fear). "
    "  Never a neutral expression. Use a cutout/photoshop-cut feel with a "
    "  subtle drop shadow so the person reads as layered over the scene.\n"
    "• Background: supports the topic — relevant setting, object, or scene "
    "  — fills the RIGHT 60–70% of the frame. Clearly contrasted from the "
    "  subject (different colors / depth / lighting).\n"
    "• Text overlay: bold heavy sans-serif, MAX 2–3 short words, very high "
    "  contrast (white with hard shadow or stroke, or saturated yellow on "
    "  dark). Positioned to NOT cover the face. Often paired with a chunky "
    "  arrow pointing at the secondary subject.\n"
    "• Props: small in-frame object (phone, gadget, food, weapon) held by "
    "  the subject reinforces the narrative — include one when natural.\n"
    "• Lighting: cinematic, dramatic, clear subject-background separation. "
    "  Rim light on the subject is great.\n"
    "• Color: high saturation, one dominant accent color tied to the topic "
    "  (e.g. red for danger, blue for tech, green for money/nature).\n"
    "• Format: 16:9, sharp focus, no motion blur on the face.\n"
    "AVOID: small text, neutral expressions, busy backgrounds, low contrast, "
    "muted/desaturated palettes, generic stock-photo poses, multiple "
    "competing focal points, watermarks, logos."
)

_FACELESS_STYLE = (
    "COMPOSITION (apply strictly — this is a YouTube thumbnail for a "
    "FACELESS video, no on-camera creator):\n"
    "• Subject: ONE dominant hero object, scene, or prop, usually CENTERED "
    "  (not off to the side). The object IS the story — choose something "
    "  symbolically loaded or visually striking (e.g. skeleton hands holding "
    "  a ring box for a 'cost of love' video; a single highlighted product "
    "  on a pile of competitors; a transformation/before-after visual).\n"
    "• Narrative via metaphor or juxtaposition — pair the hero with a "
    "  supporting visual that creates the curiosity gap (e.g. one bright "
    "  object atop a pile of defeated rivals; a small creature swarmed by "
    "  many; a clean futuristic product against a contrasting map / route / "
    "  context). With no face to carry emotion, the SETUP carries it.\n"
    "• Text overlay: LARGER and more designed than in person-focal — bold "
    "  heavy sans-serif OR decorative gothic / condensed display font. Can "
    "  flank or frame the hero (e.g. 'LUCKIN [cup] COFFEE', 'the price [box] "
    "  you pay'), or use numbers / strikethroughs as the visual device "
    "  ('30 HOURS' crossed out → '6 HOURS'). High contrast — white with "
    "  hard shadow, glowing edges, or single bright color against dark.\n"
    "• Lighting: spotlight / movie-poster / product-shot feel. Often a "
    "  single dramatic light beam on the hero from above, dark surrounding "
    "  void. OR clean editorial / explainer lighting for data-driven topics.\n"
    "• Color: disciplined palette — dark / black background + ONE saturated "
    "  accent color (deep red, neon blue, hot pink, glowing white). For "
    "  editorial-style thumbnails, use a clean limited palette (1 hero "
    "  color + 1 neutral + 1 contrast). Avoid muddy mid-tones.\n"
    "• Composition: tight, often symmetric. No wasted space. Every element "
    "  earns its place. Split layouts work when one side is the physical "
    "  hero and the other is UI / map / data overlay.\n"
    "• Texture / grain: subtle film grain or noise on dark backgrounds adds "
    "  premium feel — never on the bright hero subject itself.\n"
    "• Format: 16:9, sharp focus on the hero subject.\n"
    "AVOID: people / faces (this preset is explicitly faceless), low-contrast "
    "or muted palettes, small text, multiple competing focal points, generic "
    "stock backgrounds, off-center subjects unless paired with a deliberate "
    "left/right split."
